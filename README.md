## Capstone Project -The Battle of the Neighborhoods

## Introduction: Business Problem
In this project i have tried to find an optimal location for a restaurant. Specifically, this report will be targeted to stakeholders interested in 
opening an Italian restaurant in Berlin, Germany.
Since there are lots of restaurants in Berlin so i have tried to detect locations that are not already crowded with restaurants. 
i also particularly interested in areas with no Italian restaurants in vicinity. 
i would also prefer locations as close to city center as possible, assuming that first two conditions are met.

i have used all our data science powers to generate a few most promissing neighborhoods based on this criteria. 
Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders.
